* src/DSTAIDAPlotProcessor.cc, src/DSTCollectionProcessor.cc,
* src/DSTPlotProcessor.cc, steering/ftfordst.xml: changed DST

harderk

* include/ConversionTagger.h, src/ConversionTagger.cc: add capability to enable or disable tagging of conv,K0,Lambda0 separately
* include/ConversionTagger.h, src/ConversionTagger.cc: reject candidates coming from vicinity of the IP
* src/ConversionTagger.cc: bug fix: existing conv/V0 candidates (e.g. found by PandoraPFA prior to running ConversionTagger) were not added to the LCCollection containing all conv/V0 candidates.
* diagnostics/: include/V0Performance.h, src/V0Performance.cc: count and print total number of conv/V0 candidates separately for conv, K0, Lambda. this improves diagnostics to tune ConversionTagger cuts separately for the different candidate classes

* src/ConversionTagger.cc: reduce verbosity a bit

# v00-02-03-dev
2nd release for full-chain tests for ILD mass reconstruction.
Changes to the way the flavour tag collections are written out for DST

* TrueAngularJetProcessor + NeuralNetTrainer + PlotProcessor + AIDAPlotProcessor: changed so that the MC Truth info is stored in one LCFloatVec, in the order TrueJetFlavour, TruePDGCode, TrueHadronCharge, TruePartonCharge (Erik Devetak, Victoria Martin)
    
* 2 new processors created in order to add FT and MC Truth info to the jets using ParticleID objects This will reduce the number of collections for the mass reconstruction DSTs:

* DSTCollectionProcessor : adds 2 ParticleID algorithms to each jet: "LCFIFlavourTag": contains the flavour tagging info,  "MCTruth": contains the Monte Carlo truth info

* DSTPlotProcessor : a rewrite of PlotProcessor, which uses the DST collections  from the ParticleID objects instead of the full collections. also contains a function that will compare the parameters from both collection types and print out a message if they are different. (Clare Lynch)

# v00-02-03-pre
release for full-chain tests for ILD mass reconstruction, fixing a number of small issues found since last release and adding further functionality:
 
* steering files updated to include steering file running FullLDCTracking, PandoraPFA (instead of cheattracks+jetfind); based on current version of steering file for mass reconstruction from ILD mailing list (Clare Lynch)
 
* LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor: now compatible with RAIDA;    (Victoria Martin) corrected: "ptmasscorrection" --> "ptcorrectedmass"  (Roberval Walsh)
 
* RPCutProcessor: small bug fix: this processor should not require GEAR unless hadronic interaction removal is selected  (Kristian Harder)
 
* ZVRES: small bug fix in LCFIVertex/vertex_lcfi/zvtop/src/vertexfinderclassic.cpp to ensure consistency with ZVTOP paper  (Ben Jeffery)
 
* ZVKIN: return IP if no vertices found; sort found vertices wrt decay length from IP, in ascending order (Ben Jeffery)
 
* flavour tag inputs: code added to obtain new parameters for calculation of joint probability  from fit; currently only available if the package is run with JAIDA (Erik Devetak)

* neural network code:   minor fixes: ensured code compiles with gcc 4.2.1; (Kristian Harder, Dave Bailey) missing "const" added; at request of CALICE added class to determine the importance of the input variables  for a given data set and trained network based on the approach used in the TMVA package, see http://tmva.sourceforge.net/docu/TMVAUsersGuide.pdf p66 (Dave Bailey)

* NOTE: with this version, a new dependence on MarlinUtil is introduced; this became necessary for the ConversionTagger processor, currently under development- don't use this processor yet!  (Kristian Harder)

# v00-02-02
* LCFIVertex/vertex_lcfi/algo/src/pereventipfitter.cpp changed to use Kalman filter for vertex fitting (reduces run time for PerEventIPFitter.cc by about a factor 100) (Kalman filter developed by S. Gorbunov, I. Kisel, Vertex Package interface: Tomas Lastovicka)

* RPCutProcessor: for suppression of hadronic interactions using MC information this  processor is now updated to support arbitrary detector geometries (Kristian Harder)

* LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor: new processor providing diagnostics for flavour tag (Victoria Martin) Please note -BUILD_WITH="AIDAJNI" must be specified to cmake to build LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor
* LCFIVertex/macro/FlavourTagInputsOverlay.py: python script to create plots from output of LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor (Victoria Martin)
* LCFIVertex/macro/MakePurityVsEfficiencyRootPlot.C: root macro to plot purity vs efficiency graphs that can be written out by PlotProcessor, if compiling with root option; permits results from different runs (e.g. with different settings) to be compared (Kristian Harder) 

* vertex charge calculation: correction of algorithm to agree with the procedure developed with fast MC (Erik Devetak)
* separate VertexChargeProcessor, storing results in separate LCFloatVec collections; this used to be done in FlavourTagInputsProcessor (Erik Devetak)

# v00-01-01
* same code as v00-01 the first official release except that cmake build is supported
